<p>Even deep into the binge watching era and in a year when most of us binged more than ever before individual episodes still matter.

cut through the clutter and stuck with them in 2020.</p>

  Never Have I Ever (Netflix)</h3></a>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">Said I am Sorry.
The first season of this charmer wrapped a coming-of-age tale in a story of family grief in a teen triangle rom com.
Maitreyi Ramakrishnan gave a star making performance in the laugh-while-you-cry finale,
which earned bonus points for flawlessly paying off the series running joke of having the story of a high school girl narrated by the tennis star John McEnroe.
It served an ace at match point. (Streaming on Netflix.)</p>
